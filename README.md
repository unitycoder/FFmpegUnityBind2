With FFmpeg Unity Bind 2, you can do the following and much more:

### NOTE
- download missing mobile-ffmpeg-full-gpl-4.4.LTS.aar file from https://nexus.web.cern.ch/nexus/content/groups/public/com/arthenica/mobile-ffmpeg-full/4.4.LTS/
- place it into Assets\Plugins\Android\libs

SCREEN CAPTURING / GAME RECORDING TO FILE

Instead of capturing all system screens, the FFmpegREC 2 component captures the 3D Scene Camera view. This gives you a huge advantage over other capturing software by allowing you to record objects only on selected layers. You can exclude the UI or select specific 3D objects.

CAMERA CAPTURING / WEBCAM RECORDING TO FILE

The package captures video from a device camera and saves it to a file. The demo also shows how to render a device camera video preview. Thanks to the features mentioned above, additional objects can be rendered on top of the device camera view.

SYSTEM AUDIO RECORDING

Gain access to sounds and music inside your app.

MICROPHONE RECORDING

Optionally, you can record from the microphone. Choose the audio mode you want during video recording.

CONVERT

Transform any video format to another video or audio format.

DECODE

Unpack video into a frame/image sequence and audio file. You can then manipulate the frames/images and re-encode them.

ENCODE

Pack a frame/image sequence and audio file into an efficient compressed video. You can also create slideshows with music.

STREAM TO YOUTUBE

Easily stream to YouTube by passing the stream key.

STREAM TO OTHER RTMP, RTP, TCP, UDP SERVICES

Create custom service commands similar to those for YouTube.

CUT / TRIM / SPLIT / MAKE PIECES

Specify the start and end times of a video chunk and extract it as a file.

COMPRESS

Specify the quality parameter (0.0 - 1.0) to achieve compressed or lossless results.

CONCAT / APPEND / COMBINE / UNITE / MERGE

List all the video files you want to combine into a single video.

ADD SOUND

Replace or add an audio track to an existing video clip.

WATERMARK

Overlay an image or multiple images in any form and position on top of the video. Alternatively, place a video in a selected area on top of an image.

MULTITHREADING / ASYNC

The FFmpeg API is thread-safe, allowing you to execute commands in parallel. Convert, cut, concatenate, etc., as many files as you wish simultaneously.

PLATFORMS
